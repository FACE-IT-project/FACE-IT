<!-- Perhaps try telling a story about investigating the data and not being able to tell the story we wanted to. This could serve to be illuminative about the necessity for people to contribute their site specific data. Could talk about how the scraping of the PANGAEA data has had mixed results. -->

# Anthropogenic impacts on Isfjorden
***

<!-- Could rather give a talk about the series of failed investigations into quick questions. Show the progression of the figures and how/why they aren't useful. Remember that the purpose is to communicate the necessity to cultivate good data sources that can be used for meaningful investigations. This then could serve as a segue into -->

- What can we currently say about local anthropogenic effects on Isfjorden?
  - With a specific focus on social science data
- Keep in mind this analysis is just an example to stimulate thought about real analyses
  - These then are to be used for the review paper


# Isfjorden data
***

![__Figure 1:__ High level overview of the data available for Isfjorden. The acronyms for the variable groups seen throughout the figure are: bio = biology, chem = chemistry, cryo = cryosphere, phys = physical, soc = social (currently there are no social data for Isfjorden). A) Metadata showing the range of values available within the data. B) Spatial summary of data available per ~1 km grouping. Note that there are some important moorings outside of this bounding box that _are_ included in the data counts. C) Temporal summary of available data. D) Summmary of data available by depth. Note that all of the data summaries are log10 transformed. For C) and D) the log10 transformation is applied before the data are stacked by category, which gives the impression that there are much more data are than there are."](assets/is_fig_1.png){ width=100% }

# Summary
***

- The aggregated data products showcased in this talk are intended to be used by other FACE-IT members 
  - For their research as well as the review paper of change in the FACE-IT study sites
- The review paper is designed to be a collaborative process for many members of FACE-IT
  - Co-authorship requires contribution of data, text, figures, ideas etc.
  - Site coordinators will be contacted first
- Timeline:
  - Data collection (underway)
  - Analyses (October 2021 - April 2022)
  - Writing up (May - September 2022)
  - Manuscript submitted for review (October 2022)
