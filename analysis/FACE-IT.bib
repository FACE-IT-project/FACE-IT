abstract="This book summarizes physical and biological aspects from Kongsfjorden (78{\textdegree} 59' N, 11--12{\textdegree} E), Svalbard. The contributions to this volume cover atmospheric conditions above Ny-{\AA}lesund, as well as physical conditions in Kongsfjorden. The chapters about oceanographic dynamics and sea ice conditions are based on time-series observations of interannual variability, whereas the chapter about the underwater light regime focuses on seasonal dynamics. The pelagic system is covered by reviews of pelagic production, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Benthic flora studies address microphytobenthos and macroalgal biodiversity, as well as the physiology of kelp related to stress perception and responses. Benthic fauna communities are described with associated environmental drivers of change. An outline of an Arctic fjord ecosystem model for Kongsfjorden- Krossfjorden is presented. Data that go into models come from sampling at different stations in the marine environment, with an important contribution from long-term data series at stations. Some of the long-term data are based on recordings from autonomous underwater observatories. Finally, one summary presents Kongsfjorden as harbinger of the future Arctic.",
