abstract="This book summarizes physical and biological aspects from Kongsfjorden (78{\textdegree} 59' N, 11--12{\textdegree} E), Svalbard. The contributions to this volume cover atmospheric conditions above Ny-{\AA}lesund, as well as physical conditions in Kongsfjorden. The chapters about oceanographic dynamics and sea ice conditions are based on time-series observations of interannual variability, whereas the chapter about the underwater light regime focuses on seasonal dynamics. The pelagic system is covered by reviews of pelagic production, phytoplankton and zooplankton communities. Benthic flora studies address microphytobenthos and macroalgal biodiversity, as well as the physiology of kelp related to stress perception and responses. Benthic fauna communities are described with associated environmental drivers of change. An outline of an Arctic fjord ecosystem model for Kongsfjorden- Krossfjorden is presented. Data that go into models come from sampling at different stations in the marine environment, with an important contribution from long-term data series at stations. Some of the long-term data are based on recordings from autonomous underwater observatories. Finally, one summary presents Kongsfjorden as harbinger of the future Arctic.",

abstract="Seasonal sea ice is an important feature in Svalbard fjords for both the physical environment and the ecosystem. Systematic sea-ice monitoring in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard, as a part of a long-term project conducted by the Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI), was started in 2003. The inner part of Kongsfjorden is usually covered by seasonal fast ice initially forming between December and March and persisting until April--June. Before 2006, the sea ice typically extended into the central part of the fjord, but during the last decade the sea-ice extent has often been reduced to the northern part of the inner bay. Two exceptions were 2009 and 2011, when the ice extent was similar to earlier years. The minimum record for spring ice extent within the observed period was in 2012, when sea ice was only present in the northern part of the inner bay. Maximum seasonal thickness of fast ice was around 0.6 m or more prior to 2006, declining to about 0.2 m in recent years. The snow thickness on fjord fast ice declined from around 0.2 m in spring prior to 2006 to <0.05 m in recent years, which reflected the shorter duration of ice cover. Advection of Atlantic water into Kongsfjorden, particularly during the winters of 2006--2007, contributed to reduced fast-ice formation. This, in combination with relatively mild winters, can be seen as main factors for changing fast-ice conditions in Kongsfjorden during the last 10 years. Sea-ice extent and seasonal duration have important implications for the marine ecosystem in Kongsfjorden with regard to pelagic and benthic production as well as selected species of seabirds and marine mammals.",
