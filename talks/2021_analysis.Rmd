<!-- Multiple  key  drivers  of  change  for  Arctic  socio-ecological  fjord  and  adjacent  coastal  systems  were identified at the outset of the FACE-IT project. The available data products that contain these key drivers were indexed in a meta-database as part of WP1. In addition to documenting where the relevant data are, how to access them, and which drivers they contain, the available data have also been downloaded and aggregated into data products that are currently available to FACE-IT members. A quick overview of the key drivers is provided before introducing the meta-database and an overview of the data of interest. The talk is concluded with a demonstration of how the data aggregated for Isfjorden may be used for a range of investigations from physical, to biological, to social. The aggregated data products showcased in this talk are intended to be used by other FACE-IT members for their research as well as to be used for a review of change in the FACE-IT study sites. -->

# Key drivers
***

__Key Cryosphere Drivers__   

> __Coastal ice__: formation/break up date, thickness; __Fast ice__: extent, thickness; __Glacier__: land mass balance, terminating edge; __Permafrost__: temperature, thickness;  __Sea ice__: concentration, extent, freeboard, thickness; __Snow cover__: thickness

__Key Physical Drivers__  
  
> __Bathymetry__; __Current__: direction, location, volume; __Evaporation__; __Heatflux__: net, latent/sensible, long/shortwave radiation; __Light extinction coefficient__; __Mixed layer depth__; __Precipitation__; __River discharge__; __Salinity__; __Sea level pressure__; __Seawater temperature__: surface, mid, bottom; __Sedimentation rate__; __Suspended matter__: organic, mineral; __Wind__: direction, speed

__Key Chemistry Drivers__  
  
> __CaCO~3~ saturation state__; __Dissolved inorganic carbon__; __Dissolved organic carbon__; __Dissolved organic nitrogen__; __Dissolved O~2~__; __Nutrients__: nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, phosphate, silicate; __Partial pressure of CO~2~__; __pH__; __Total alkalinity__

__Key Biology Drivers__  

> __Calcification__; __Nitrogen fixation__; __Photosynthesis__; __Primary production__; __Respiration__; __Species__: presence/absence, abundance/biomass

__Key Social Drivers__  

> __Fish landings__: commercial, recreational, quotas, seasonality; __Game landings__: quotas, seasonality; __Local and national resource management__; __National statistics__: demography, income, unemployment; __Tourist arrivals__: per month, nationality; __Tourist vessels__: count, mileage

# Meta-database
***

# Follow the outline in the submitted abstract

# Have a specific focus on social science data
## This is important because little effort has been done for social science so fart
## List the social science data that have been identified
## Solicit new input from people in the crowd about other social data, including Greenland
## What sort of non-social data do social scientists want
## Get the number of inhabitants of Longyearbyen over time and relate that to nutrient concentration
# Keep in mind that this analysis is just an example to stimulate the audience to think about real analyses
# These then are to be used for the review paper
