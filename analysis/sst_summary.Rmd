# Overview

This document contains a summary of the NOAA OISST data that have been extracted around the FACE-IT sites.

# Svalbard

## Kongsfjorden

![__Figure 1:__ A) Average annual SST from 1982-2020. B) Decadal trends in SST calculated with annual averages from 1982-2020. Pixels with significant trends (p <= 0.05) are framed in blacke Note that the pixels in the NOAA OISST product are ~25km so there are no data within Kongsfjorden. One must also be cautious of the effect of land bleed on the temperatures for pixels that contain coastline.](assets/sst_grid_kong.png)

## Isfjorden
