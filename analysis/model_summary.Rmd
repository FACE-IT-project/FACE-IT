# Overview

This document contains a summary of the model data made available by Morten Skogen of the FACE-IT project.


<!-- # European Arctic -->


# Svalbard

## Kongsfjorden

Model temperatures. There are many more variables available within the models.

Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A.](assets/model_kong.png)
