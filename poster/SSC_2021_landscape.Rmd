# Overview

For the Horizon2020 project **FACE-IT**, experts from the social and natural sciences identified a list of key drivers of change in European Arctic fjord and adjacent coastal socio-ecological systems. Datasets containing these key drivers were sourced, aggregated (Table \@ref(tab:tab1)), and are referenced in a central [meta-database](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/metadatabase.html) (_follow QR code_). An example analysis highlights the functionality of these data. Data portals like [NPDC](https://data.npolar.no/home/), [SIOS](https://sios-svalbard.org/metadata_search), [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/), and others provide a lot of **FAIR** data (**F**indable, **A**vailable, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable) for Svalbard. However, should an investigation require access to multiple different variables (e.g. ocean temperature, ChlA, sea ice thickness, tourist arrivals, etc.) researchers may find themselves spending more time on data wrangling than on research. This is a limitation to the **I**nteroperability and **R**euseability of data on these data portals that currently requires a research team to have a dedicated data scientist to manage.

# Example analysis

With great amounts of data come great possibilities. To highlight the utility of data aggregated for **FACE-IT**, key drivers in Kongsfjorden were averaged by date, depth, and regions adapted from Hop et al. (2002; The marine ecosystem of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). Then temperature (°C) data were compared to: oxygen (% sat), chlorophyll A (μg/L), & PAR (μmol/m^2/s) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig2)). With the exception of PAR data in the middle fjord, there was not enough overlap between temperature and the other key drivers to determine meaningful relationships. This highlights the need to find additional datasets for these key drivers.
<!-- and shows that focussed datasets from dedicated data portals like [NPDC](https://data.npolar.no/home/) and [SIOS](https://sios-svalbard.org/metadata_search) generally have more utility than hundreds of datasets scraped from larger data portals like [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/). -->

<!-- Better introduction to why this analysis was done and how and where the data were collected. Specify that they are marine. -->

<!-- Add more conclusion here about why this is important -->
