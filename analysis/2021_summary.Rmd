# Cross-package interactions
***

- Ny-Ã…lesund, Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (July - August, 2021)
  - Participated in fieldwork for WP3
  - Worked adjacent to WP2
- Data collections efforts

## Effective coordination of data collection 

- Who is responsible for what?
- Who has other people working with data collection?
- WP1 is of service to everybody, but we can't provide this service without replies to our inquiries

<br>


# Data issues
***

- What to do with complex data types
  - e.g. Seabird database and geospatial glacier fronts

## Inglefieldbukta

- Is the current Inglefieldbukta bounding box to small?
- What is the scientific justification of choosing a much larger semi-open fjord?
- Current area (figure)
- Potential expanded area (figure)

<br>


# What's next?
***

- D1.3: [Review article](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/review.html) (24 months)
  - Intended as broad overview of drivers of change in FACE-IT study sites
  - Will require expertise from many FACE-IT researchers
  - WP1 will reach out to site coordinators as fist step in collaborative process

<br>


# Summary
***

- 3 key grabbing points
- Need to focus on the importance
