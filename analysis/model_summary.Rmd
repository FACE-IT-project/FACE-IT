# Overview

This document contains a summary of the model data made available by Morten Skogen of the FACE-IT project.


<!-- # European Arctic -->


# Svalbard

## Kongsfjorden

Model temperatures. There are many more variables available within the models.

```{r kong-summary-1, fig.height=10, width=10, fig.cap="__Figure 1:__ A) Average model temperatures at depths for different RCP projections. Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A."}

# Load model
model_kong <- load_model("kongsfjorden_rcp")

# Model visuals
model_summary(model_kong, "Kongsfjorden")
```

## Isfjorden

```{r is-summary-1, fig.height=10, width=10, fig.cap="__Figure 2:__ A) Average model temperatures at depths for different RCP projections. Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A."}

# Load model
model_is <- load_model("isfjorden_rcp")

# Model visuals
model_summary(model_is, "Isfjorden")
```

## Inglefieldbukta

```{r ingle-summary-1, fig.height=10, width=10, fig.cap="__Figure 3:__ A) Average model temperatures at depths for different RCP projections. Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A."}

# Load model
model_ingle <- load_model("inglefieldbukta_rcp")

# Model visuals
model_summary(model_ingle, "Inglefieldbukta")
```

# Greenland

## Young Sound

```{r young-summary-1, fig.height=10, width=10, fig.cap="__Figure 4:__ A) Average model temperatures at depths for different RCP projections. Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A."}

# Load model
model_young <- load_model("young_sound_rcp")

# Model visuals
model_summary(model_young, "Young Sound")
```

## Disko Bay

There are no model data for the western side of Greenland.

## Nuup Kangerlua

There are no model data for the western side of Greenland.

# Norway

## Porsangerfjorden

```{r por-summary-1, fig.height=10, width=10, fig.cap="__Figure 5:__ A) Average model temperatures at depths for different RCP projections. Note that the model data are not on a cartesian coordinate grid so the data are shown here as points instead of as a raster. B) Trends in model temperatures at different depths and RCP projections. Straight lines show linear models fitted to each point in panel A."}

# Load model
model_por <- load_model("porsangerfjorden_rcp")
