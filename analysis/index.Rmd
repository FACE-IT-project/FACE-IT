Welcome to the GitHub pages site for work package one (WP1) of [FACE-IT](https://www.face-it-project.eu/). This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement # 869154. The primary purpose of this site is to provide a convenient user interface for the summaries of the drivers of change in the European Arctic as well as the meta-database for the data needed by the various work packages (WPs) in the FACE-IT project. As analyses are completed to understand the drivers of change at the FACE-IT study sites they will be added to this site.

Please use the tabs at the top of the site to navigate. To see a summary of the key drivers click the "Key drivers" tab. Clicking on the "Meta-database" tab will go to the page that contains the meta-database for the key drivers of change at the FACE-IT study sites. A more in depth review of these drivers may be found by clicking the "Review of drivers" tab. The "Analyses" tabs contains discrete analyses performed on data in the Arctic that may be of interest to FACE-IT members and the broader public (currently inactive). To see the raw code used for the workflow/pipeline of these analyses please follow the link in the top right of this page to the `source code` repository. Once there the raw workflow code may be found in the `code/` folder in various scripts, and the markdown files for the analyses may be found in the `analysis` folder. The functions etc. utilised throughout the code base may be found in the `code/functions.R` script. The code used to create the figures and tables may be found in the `code/visualising.R` script. Please note that not all of the objects used in these scripts are saved in the GitHub repo  as many of them are far too large. For these larger files one will need to request access to the FACE-IT pCloud folder. Or one may search the meta-database tables for links to where the original data may be downloaded.

<!-- Add text better explaining the sections and sub-sections and why they have been organised thus. -->
<!-- Also need to better address social drivers. Write about this up front here. -->

A short summary of the FACE-IT project:  

> Glacier fronts and sea ice systems are hotspots of biodiversity. Their retreat will pose threats to Arctic coastal ecosystem function and eventually local livelihoods. The Arctic is a harbinger of the consequences of multiple global and regional environmental change on ecosystems and livelihoods: The overarching objective of FACE-IT is to enable adaptive co-management of social-ecological fjord systems in the Arctic in the face of rapid cryosphere and biodiversity changes.
