# Overview

Data portals like [NPDC](https://data.npolar.no/home/), [SIOS](https://sios-svalbard.org/metadata_search), [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/), and others provide a lot of **FAIR** data (**F**indable, **A**vailable, **I**nteroperable, and **R**euseable) for Svalbard. However, should an investigation require access to multiple different variables (e.g. ocean temperature, ChlA, sea ice thickness, tourist arrivals) researchers may find themselves inundated with various data files and formats, which may lead to more time spent on data wrangling than on research. This is a stumbling block in the **R**euseability of the data currently hosted on data portals. As part of the Horizon2020 project **FACE-IT**, experts across many fields of social and natural sciences identified a list of important drivers of change in European Arctic fjord and adjacent coastal socio-ecological systems. These data were sourced, aggregated (Table \@ref(tab:tab1)), and are referenced in a central [meta-database](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/metadatabase.html) (_follow QR code_). An example analysis highlights the functionality of these combined data.

# Example analysis

Key drivers in Kongsfjorden were averaged by date, depth, and regions adapted from Hop et al. (2002; The marine ecosystem of Kongsfjorden, Svalbard) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). Comparisons of these averaged values were made between temperature (°C) and oxygen (% sat), chlorophyll A (μg/L), & PAR (μmol/m^2/s) (Figure \@ref(fig:fig2)). With the exception of PAR data in the middle fjord, there was not enough overlap between temperature and the other variables to determine any significant relationships. This highlights the need to find additional datasets for these key drivers.

<!-- Better introduction to why this analysis was done and how and where the data were collected. Specify that they are marine. -->

<!-- Add more conclusion here about why this is important -->
