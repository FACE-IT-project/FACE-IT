<!-- General info about talk -->
<!-- Presentations are branded as “lightning talks” – so they need to be short and concise. 
You have a total of 10 minutes each, including Q&A time (so really you should aim for 8 minutes total). -->
<!-- Please also remember the overall thread through the webinar, which is about filling gaps in the IPCC reports.
So it would be good for you to refer to the latest IPCC report and how your work is filling important gaps -->
<!-- https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_CCP6.pdf -->
<!-- Finally, if you are presenting work from ECOTIP and FACE-IT (which I assume is the case), please make sure to include the EU logo and the “financed under.. by grant #)” - we are expecting a lot of EU Commission staff on the webinar -->

## Outline

-   Categories of socio-ecological Arctic fjord systems
  -   Drivers within those categories
    -   Variables within those drivers
-   What data are available for all of these
  -   Sites, dates, depths, etc. as reasonable/interesting
  -   Show using barplots or something like that
  -   Maybe need a map of the study sites
  -   Could show total collected datasets and data points as bar plot with datasets going back out the negative x axis and data points along the positive axis. Then relabel everything accordingly.
  -   If using plotly then rollover tool tips could be used in an intriguing way
-   How do all of these drivers relate
  -   Network plot
  -   Make a fully documented interactive plot
  
  ## Notes
  
  -   Arctic warming faster than almost anywhere
