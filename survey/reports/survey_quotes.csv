conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,sea urchins can be of interest for fishery as well
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,increasing populations / grazing of sea urchins - what will the future bring in Arctic kelp forest ecosystems (e.g. appreance of sea urchin barrens as in Norway)
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,"Despite rapid changes and uncertainties in the Arctic, I expect tourism volume to keep increasing in the next decades."
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,"There are many opprtounties for the tourism sector and host communities: longer seasons, greater access to areas previously inaccessible."
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"Increased risks, especially in terms of natural hazards but also balancing environmental degradation with increased tourism volume and the pressure that creates on the environment, on infrastructure and on community well-being."
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,"New environmental conditions and growing tourism are expected. Geopolitical situation in the Arctic might remain tense, possible increase in tensions if greater/easier access to some areas and nature resources. Growing conflicting interests between different areal and resources usages (commercial fisheries, leisure fisheries, tourism, research, nature protection, resources extraction, military activities...). Traditional governance schemes might struggle to address these issues due to diverging interests between governments, between local stakeholders..."
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,"Growing fisheries and tourism activities as sea ice is retreating, expansion to new and larger areas"
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"Distribution of (fish) species is evolving, which is impacting the whole ecosystem and will affect livelihoods; evolving climate conditions that might affect both positively and negatively some human activities (ship traffic, activities dependent on snow/ice...)"
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,"with temp increase and retreating ice our Arctic sites will become more and more similar to North Atlantic sites i.e. Faroer, Iceland, with all implications to livelihoods and biodiv. key word: ""Ecol. Blender"""
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,"Economic opportunities: Northern Shipping routes, Nordic aquaculture at the expense of ecological losses"
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,everlasting conflict of economy vs. conservation
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,"I expect that better observation systems, satellite sensors, autonomous systems and data base development along with more common agreement on FAIR data will give in future more and better possibilities to detect and interpret changes in the physical, chemical and biological system components of fjords and coasts."
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,"Use of new technological/data developments for monitoring, analyses and research."
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"Future funding for research and monitoring, especially for longterm monitoring can be a challenge, as well as limitations for collaboration and access due to the geopolitical development."
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,Further sea ice decrease and glacier retreats affecting ice associated species
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,More access to navigation and possibilities for more sea-based production activities
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"Mitigation and adaptation to ongoing changes, namely those resulting from higher accessibility that may lead to increased environmental impacts in otherwise pristine environments."
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,"With ongoing climate warming macroalgal communities exposed to glacial melt will intermediatly decrease before increasing again after glacial melt has terminated. 
Seaweed communities in Kongsfjorden will tranform into communities with species diversity and biomass similar to North Norwegian fjord systems over time. 
At sites with no glacial melt seaweed biomass and habitats will increase in future."
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,Ice-free coasts with low human impact may provide an opportunity for seaweed aquaculture and production of healty food alternatives. This may become more important the more polluted southern sites become.
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"Management of sustainable aquaculture; Documentation of complete species diversity, geographical distribution changes and Arctic species conservation; Too few data points to fill existing knowledge gaps on seaweed communities and future predictions; Even if the Arctic becomes warmer it is still remote and logistically difficult to get continuos monitoring data specifically over wider areas"
conclusion,conclusion,Expectations,major ecosystem changes due to climate change
conclusion,conclusion,Opportunities,"some areas become more accessible, some ecosystems will expand"
conclusion,conclusion,Challenges,"increased accessibility increases the risk of human disturbance and poses a need for new management strategies/environmental protection. Of cause there are also many other challenges connected with the melting cryosphere, such as global sea level rise."
