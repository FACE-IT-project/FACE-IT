The interactive tables found below contain the meta-database for the datasets that contain key drivers of change in fjord and adjacent coastal socio-ecological systems of the seven FACE-IT study sites ([D1.1](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/key_drivers.html)). These tables may be searched for key words. One may also click at the top of each column to order the rows in ascending/descending order. Datasets that are restricted to a single FACE-IT study site (e.g. mooring data from Kongsfjorden) are listed in the corresponding meta-datatable below and one may jump to these tables quickly using the table of contents (TOC) on the left. Datasets that encompass the entire European Arctic are listed in their own meta-datatable rather than being listed repeatedly in the tables for individual sites. The same applies respectively for datasets that encompass Svalbard, Greenland, and Norway/Barents Sea. Nearly all of the datasets listed here were collected through some means of _in situ_ sampling however, for some important drivers (e.g. sea ice cover) gridded data from remotely sampled or modelled datasets were sourced and are listed in the meta-datatables for each site.

This website was created for D1.2 for the Horizon2020 project [FACE-IT](https://www.face-it-project.eu/). The datasets identified within this document were used for the completion of a [review article](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cambridge-prisms-coastal-futures/article/drivers-of-change-in-arctic-fjord-socioecological-systems-examples-from-the-european-arctic/1129E92425F6012F9610D8C9C172B2F0#article) and [data paper](https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2022-455/) on past and future changes of key drivers in and around the FACE-IT study sites (D1.3). The data for these publications were amalgamated and published on [PANGAEA](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.953115). To aid in the exploration of these data a [user interface](http://choc.imev-mer.fr/shiny/dataAccess/) was constructed.

## Column definitions

The interactive tables found below contain the following columns:

- Type: The method of data collection/creation (e.g. _in situ_ vs remote sensing)
- Category: The [category(s)](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/key_drivers.html) of data within the dataset
- Driver: The [driver(s)](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/key_drivers.html) found within the dataset
- Date: The years over which any data in the given dataset were collected
- Citation: A clickable pop-up window that provides the citation for the dataset
- Link: A clickable link to the website were the dataset may be downloaded
- Accessed: The date on which the dataset was last accessed for the FACE-IT project

## Data access

Many of the datasets listed below are available from multiple established data sources. Large gridded data sets for most physical drivers at the Arctic scale can be accessed via: [Copernicus](https://marine.copernicus.eu/), [EMODnet](https://www.emodnet.eu/en), and [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/). Site specific datasets can be accessed via: [NPDC](https://data.npolar.no/home/), [NSF](https://arcticdata.io/), [openpolar](https://openpolar.no/), [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/), and [SIOS](https://sios-svalbard.org/metadata_search). Data for drivers pertaining more to policy may be found at: [INTAROS](https://intaros.nersc.no/) and [SAON](https://www.arcticobserving.org/). The data portals for national statistics and other social drivers are: [Gr√∏nlands statistik](https://stat.gl/dialog/topmain.asp?lang=da&subject=Fiskeri%20og%20fangst&sc=FI), [kystverket](https://ais-public.kystverket.no/ais-download/), [SSB](https://www.ssb.no/), and [statistikknett](https://statistikknett.no/).

# European Arctic

This section contains meta-data for pan-Arctic datasets.

Note that there are many sources of fisheries data in the Barents Sea (e.g. via [IMR](https://gbif.imr.no/ipt/) and [MOSJ](https://www.mosj.no/en/fauna/marine/)) that are not listed here as they do not contain data within any of the seven fjords focussed on by FACE-IT.

```{r EU-arctic-meta-data}

```

# Svalbard

While not a study site itself, there are many studies and datasets that focus on Svalbard broadly, rather than individual study sites within this region. Therefore this geographical region has it's own meta-data table.

```

## Storfjorden

Data for Inglefieldbukta on the data portals identified in D1.1 are incredibly scarce. There are however several time series for the larger Storfjorden complex and so after the 2021 annual meeting it was decided to expand the Inglefieldbukta site to Storfjorden.

# Greenland

See the EU Arctic figure above for where the Greenland sites are located. They are too spread out to be shown here in a single figure with any better precision than the full study area.

There is a wealth of national statistics data available for Greenland via their [national statistics](https://stat.gl/default.asp?lang=en) website. 

Please note that all GEM files must be downloaded directly from the URLs provided. Under the agreement between FACE-IT and GEM, these datasets are not to be accessible via the [FACE-IT data access app](http://choc.imev-mer.fr/shiny/dataAccess/). This is primarily so that GEM can track the individual downloads of their files and the purpose for why they were downloaded. This also requires that users of the data read a user agreement file. 

The following table contains datasets for Greenland generally that are relevant to the FACE-IT project, but do not necessarily apply to a specific site.

```{r green-meta-data}
metadata_green <- meta_proc("green")
```

```{r green-meta-data-table}
DT::datatable(metadata_green, rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE, colnames = DT_cols,
              caption = "Table 6: The datasets containing key drivers for Greenland.")

# Norway

The [national statistics](https://www.ssb.no/en) website for Norway is very complete, and may provide the interested researcher with a wealth of information. But note that the focus of the statistics is mostly on 'city living', and the relevant environmental statistics are a bit buried. There are however datasets that are directly relevant to FACE-IT, though perhaps not Porsangerfjorden specifically, and so are provided in the table below. This includes datasets that cover the Barents Sea.

```{r nor-meta-data}
metadata_nor <- meta_proc(c("nor", "Barents Sea"))
```

```{r nor-meta-data-table}
DT::datatable(metadata_nor, rownames = FALSE, escape = FALSE, colnames = DT_cols,
              caption = "Table 10: The datasets containing key drivers for Norway and the Barents Sea.")
```
