# Overview

This document contains a summary of the data products produced for WP1 of the FACE-IT project. These data are available to all FACE-IT members via password protected pCloud access. These data are also used in the [meta-analysis review](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/review.html) of the key drivers of change to arctic fjord ecosystems, which is a 24 month (October, 2022) deliverable.

## Kongsfjorden

High level summary of data available for Kongsfjorden.

![__Figure 1:__ High level overview of the data available for Kongsfjorden. The acronyms for the variable groups seen throughout the figure are: bio = biology, chem = chemistry, cryo = cryosphere, phys = physical, soc = social (currently there are no social data for Kongsfjorden). A) Metadata showing the range of values available within the data. B) Spatial summary of data available per ~1 km grouping. C) Temporal summary of available data. D) Summmary of data available by depth. Note that all of the data summaries are log10 transformed. For C) and D) the log10 transformation is applied before the data are stacked by category, which gives the impression that there are much more data are than there are.](assets/summary_kong.png)

Monthly average values for temperature and salinity data. These are taken as illustrative figures for the data that are likely available per month as they are generally the two most highly sampled variables in marine science.

![__Figure 2:__ Monthly climatologies for data at Kongsfjorden. The entire range of data was used for the climatology period. A) Temperature climatolgies at depths for all of Kongsfjorden. B) Spatial surface (0 to 10 m) temperature climatologies. C) Salinity climatologies at depth for all of Kongsfjorden. Note the much higher salinity for February and how most of the values are much lower than would be assumed. Probably due to a different sort of salinity calculation being used. D) Spatial surface (0 to 10 m) salinity climatologies.](assets/clim_kong.png)

Trends in temperature and salinity data.

![__Figure 3:__ Trends in A) temperature and B) salinity at different depth groups. The average annual values for all data are shown as diamonds, and the annual trends for these values are shown as coloured lines. There also appear to be two different types of salinity measurements. A long record of values close to 20 and a more recent addition of higher values around 32-35. One assumes that the lower values are measures of runoff and not proper ocean water.](assets/trend_kong.png)
