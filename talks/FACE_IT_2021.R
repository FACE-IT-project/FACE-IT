# talks/FACE_IT_2021.R
# This script contains the code used for the analyses shown in 
# the talk given for the FACE-IT 2021 annual meeting

# TODO: Two talks
# One as a WP1 update for just the work package
  # Answer the questions in the meeting agenda update
  # Talk about issue with Inglefieldbukta bounding box
  # What is the scientific justification of choosing a semi-open fjord and one that is so large
  # Give Janne a heads up first
# The other as the talk that has an abstract submitted
# Ask Janne about cruise ship arrival/presence data for Isfjorden
# Ask someone in Kings Bay (Geir as a first point of contact) for cruise ships in Kongsfjorden
  # Ship size and number of tourists where possible
  # This could be tracked down by getting the ship names then doing a bit of digging
# Question for Grete: Is the disappearance of sea ice promoting tourism in the two Svalbard fjords
# What may the triad relationship be between sea ice, cruise ships, and plankton biomass


# Talk 1:
# Discuss the data issues
# Add a talking point to the WP1 talk about effectively coordinating between other data managers
## Who is responsible for what?
## Who has other people working with data collection
## What should be done about more complex data types like 
## Explain that WP1 is of service to everybody, but we can't provide this service without replies
# Discuss complex data types like the seabird database and the geospatial glacier fronts
# Potentially finish with the region analysis of Kongsfjorden and show people the link to where all the site analyses are
## Boxplots could be useful as well as dot/line plots
## Ask about what to do with cryosphere/atmospheric land data


# Talk 2:
# Have a specific focus on social science data
## This is important because little effort has been done for social science so fart
## List the social science data that have been identified
## Solicit new input from people in the crowd about other social data, including Greenland
## What sort of non-social data do social scientists want
## Get the number of inhabitants of Longyearbyen over time and relate that to nutrient concentration
# Keep in mind that this analysis is just an example to stimulate the audience to think about real analyses
# These then are to be used for the review paper


# Setup -------------------------------------------------------------------

source("code/functions.R")



# Data --------------------------------------------------------------------



# Analyses ----------------------------------------------------------------

# Show what the relationship has been between ship mileage and temperature or ice change
# Then show what the different model RCP projections are and what the future may hold
# Also use these relationship projections for any sort of biomass

# TODO:
# Create statistics about how many data files there are. 
# Who has been contacted. 
# How many we have and what has been added
# Solicit audience for new datasets that have not been identified and that are available
# Read the Kongsfjorden ecosystem book chapter about mooring data
# Have a slide at the end of the science talk about co-authorship for the review article
  # It requires contribution of data, text, figures, ideas etc.
  # The obvious contributors are the site coordinators and who they think are specialists in certain aspects at there site
# Think of a timeline for the review article

# The data from Google sheet 99 is kongsfjorden/d_all.rds
# Contact JP about any questions regarding the data
# Also contact JP for the reference for the data
  # There is a draft data paper at the moment but not ready yet
