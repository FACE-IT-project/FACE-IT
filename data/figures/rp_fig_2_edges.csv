s01,s06,decrease,increase,Decreasing sea ice allows for more light penetration
s01,s11,decrease,complex,Lack of sea ice reduces species that depend on it while also allowing for new species to enter
s04,s01,increase,decrease,Atlantic water inflow melts sea ice more rapidly
s16,s01,increase,decrease,Atlantic water inflow melts sea ice more rapidly
s02,s03,decrease,increase,As glaciers melt this leads to increased discharge
s02,s11,decrease,complex,When glaciers shift from marine to land terminating it can cause massive changes to species assemblage
s02,s15,decrease,increase,As substratum under glaciers is exposed via melt it may release CO2 into the atmosphere
s02,s19,decrease,decrease,Shifting to land-terminating will end glacier front upwelling
s03,s04,increase,increase,Terrestrial waters tend to be warmer than marine water
s03,s05,increase,decrease,Discharge tends to be fresh so mixing lowers fjord salinity
s03,s06,increase,decrease,Discharge waters usually increase turbidity thereby reducing light availability
s03,s07,increase,increase,Discharge increases some aspects of the carbonate system
s03,s08,increase,increase,Discharge generally has more nutrients than the fjord waters it mixes with
s03,s19,increase,decrease,Discharge can create a fresh surface layer that inhibits upwelling
s15,s04,increase,increase,The greenhouse effect of increase atmospheric CO2 warms sea water as well as air temperatures
s16,s04,increase,increase,A large cause of local seawater temperature warming in Western Svalbard is increased Atlantic water inflow
s01,s04,decrease,increase,Less sea ice allows seawater temperatures to increase more rapidly
s17,s05,increase,decrease,Increasing precipitation will lead to reduced surface salinities
s05,s11,decrease,complex,Decreasing salinity will change the trophic balance of species as some will cope better than others
s05,s07,decrease,increase,Decreasing seawater salinity increases DIC and pCO2
s06,s11,complex,complex,Increasing light levels are generally regarded to increase species richness but it is unclear if light will increase or decrease
s06,s10,complex,complex,More light will likely lead to more biomass but it is unclear if where light levels will increase or decrease
s18,s06,increase,decrease,Cloudiness will likely increase thereby lowering light levels
s15,s07,increase,increase,Atmospheric CO2 fluxes into the surface affecting most aspects of the carbonate system
s07,s11,increase,decrease,Increased fjord water acidity will inhibit the growth of important shell forming phyto/zooplankton species
s19,s08,increase,increase,If upwelling increases this will increase nutrient available likewise for decreases
s04,s09,increase,increase,Increasing sea water temperatures will likely increase primary productivity in the Arctic
s06,s09,complex,complex,Light drives primary production in the Arctic but it is unclear if light will increase or decrease in the future
s08,s09,increase,increase,Increased nutrients will allow for both more primary production and for shifts in the time of year when blooms occur
s09,s10,increase,increase,Greater primary production allows for a bottom up system-wide increase to biomass
s16,s10,increase,increase,Atlantic water inflow will likely driver greater biomass
s04,s10,increase,increase,Increasing seawater temperatures will generally allow for greater biomass in fjords
s05,s10,decrease,decrease,Freshening water will likely have a negative impact on the growth of most endemic species
s01,s10,decrease,increase,While reducing sea ice will be negative for some species overall it will lead to gains in biomass
s04,s11,increase,complex,Increasing seawater temperatures will initially negatively affect species richness but as Boreal species encroach into fjords this value will rise
s10,s11,increase,increase,As biomass increases this will increase the possibility for a greater range of species within fjords
s14,s11,increase,decrease,As fjords borealise the ongoing pressure from fisheries may accelerate local extinction of target species
s12,s13,increase,decrease,Pro-environmental governance policies would reduce the impact of mass tourism
s12,s14,increase,decrease,Pro-environmental governance policies would reduce the extractive proclivities of fisheries
s12,s15,increase,decrease,Governance policies could be used to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions
s12,s12,complex,complex,Governance may be used to govern governance
s13,s08,increase,increase,Increasing human traffic will lead to greater inputs of nutrients
s13,s06,increase,increase,The ships and infrastructure for tourism increase light levels throughout the winter
s13,s11,increase,complex,Increased human movement up to the Arctic increases the invasion of non-native species which will negatively impact indigenous species
s14,s10,increase,decrease,Increasing extraction from fisheries will reduce biomass in target species
