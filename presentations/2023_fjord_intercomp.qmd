## Overview

- This presentation focuses on which data are available for the variables of interest for a fjord intercomparison.
- It does this by first listing what those variables are. Then shows the time period over which those data area available, with a daily sum per year and the overlap between sites.
- __NB:__ These slides may scroll vertically.

## Variables of interest

-  areas, volumes, bathymetry, sil presence
-  presence/absence of tidewater and land-terminating glaciers
-  freshwater flows and tidal differences - so that we could compare the tidal volume exchanges with river fluxes, evaluating the relative importance of each
-  defining which water masses dominate in the various fjords, based on temperature and salinity data
-  nutrient data
-  chlorophyll data
-  zooplankton data
-  sea ice data - extension, thickness
-  water turbidity data
-  any types of diversity data covering from microorganisms to invertebrates and fish
-  seaweed data

## Bathymetry etc.

- I'll not show the data here, but thanks to the bottom PAR dataset project we have very high (~50-200 m) evenly gridded and complete bathymetry data for all fjords.
- Areas and volumes could then be calculated relatively easily from these data.
- A quick survey of FACE-IT experts should let us know which fjords have sils and which don't.

## Sea ice

- To my knowledge, there are no remotely sensed data on sea ice thickness.
- Nor have I found any modelled or _in situ_ data.
- Therefore almost all sea ice data are remotely sensed.
- That being said, an intercomparison for this variable is simple.

## Presence/absence and type of glacier

- Glacier presence/type can be answered with expert knowledge from FACE-IT members
- Available glacier data range from ice thickness to glacier mass balance
- Data overlap does not necessarily mean a comparison can be made

## Freshwater flows and tidal differences

- There are a lot of runoff data, but they may measure very different things and we would have to look closely at how intercomparable they are.
- I do not currently have any data on tifdal flows.
- Nor any data on water movement in/out of fjords, but these data do exist via ADCP's on morrings at fjord mouth's.

## Defining water masses

- Copious amounts of seawater temperature and salinity data have been collected at many depths.
- Here I just show salinity data, because they are always collected with temperature.
- This may require a bit of work to determine water mass from irregular _in situ_ data, but should be possible

## Light

- While not on the original list, thanks to the new botttom PAR dataset it should be possible to make interesting intercomparisons of surface PAR, Kd, and bottom PAR.
- I've not shown the data here because we are still working on them and they haven't been added to the FACE-IT dataset.
- But here are the p-curves.

## Water turbidity

- At first it was decided to collect turbidity data.
- But after the first round of data queries I realised that these data are scarce and not regular between sites.
- I do have some DIC, DIM, DOM, etc. data, but they are not cleaned up so I haven't shown them here.
- I would rather use the PAR dataset (Kd in this case) as it is much easier to work with and spatially+temporally complete for all sites.

## Nutrients

- Direct intercomparisons would be difficult/impossible.
- But it may be possible to create rough climatologies of nutrients for intercomparisons.
- Also note that there are several different nutrients, so any overlapping data shown here are not necessarily the same variable

## Chlorophyll

- The lack of Chla data for many sites was a surprise.
- It should be possible to find these data for all sites.
- Otherwise intercomparisons between multiple sites should be possible.

## Phyto/zooplankton

- In v1.0 of the FACE-IT dataset it is not readily possible to separate out different taxa/species/functional groups.
- If one knows which species one wants, they can easily be targeted.
- However, with the exception of macroalgae, I do not have knowledge of Arctic species Latin names to filter out just plankton here.
- The intern we had at WP1 in the spring has thought of a clever way to address this issue, which will be implemented.
- But for now I am just showing all species counts.

## Seaweed

- There are some seaweed data available at a few sites, but these are not general comparable.
- This would require some thought for an intercomparison.
- Perhaps a more qualitative approach. E.g. presence/dominance of certain species.
- I am not worried that we can find the expertise in FACE-IT to answer macroalgae questions :P

## Species diversity

- Everything else from microorganisms to invertebrates and fish
- The changes to the dataset to answer the phyto/zooplankton and macroalgae questions will naturally allow us to investigate this final level.
