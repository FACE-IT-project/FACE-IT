### D1.1

-   D1.1 (6 months): [Report on key drivers of changes in Arctic biodiversity](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/key_drivers.html)

### D1.2
-   D1.2 (12 months): [Meta-database](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/metadatabase.html)

```{r key-drivers-table, eval=TRUE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)

## Cryosphere
cryo_vars <- data.frame(Category = "Cryosphere", Drivers = "Sea ice, glacier mass balance, glacial/river discharge")

## Physical
phys_vars <- data.frame(Category = "Physical", Drivers = "Sea temperature, salinity, light")

## Chemistry
chem_vars <- data.frame(Category = "Physical", Drivers = "Carbonate system, nutrients")

## Biology
bio_vars <- data.frame(Category = "Biology", Drivers = "Primary production, biomass, species richness")

## Social
soc_vars <- data.frame(Category = "Social", Drivers = "Policy, tourism, fisheries")

# Combine and print

### Review

-   D1.3 (24 months): Review article on drivers of change in fjords
    -   Two papers for submission end of October
        -   Review paper (\~90% complete)
            -   Submission to Coastal Futures
        -   Data paper (\~50% complete)
            -   Planned submission to ESSD

### Management

-   D8.3 (30 months): Update on DMP
    -   Little change will be needed from the original
-   D1.4 (40 months): Compile social science data
    -   Pending completion of collection (\~+1 year)

### Compilation

-   D1.5 (42 months): Final data compilation
    -   Compiling [FACE-IT member datasets](https://zenodo.org/communities/face-it/search?page=1&size=20) and uploading to PANGAEA
    -   Data on Zenodo will be published on PANGAEA
    -   As research projects finish they will be compiled
:::

## Data collection

-   Documentation of the data collection, combination, and analysis in data paper (D1.3)
-   Nearly all identified data have been compiled
-   Thousands of additional datasets have been harvested from PANGAEA <!-- -   Exception of research cruise and species presence data -->
-   User interface ([UI](https://193.50.85.104:4949/dataAccess/)) for FACE-IT members

## Other WP1 activities

![](../logo/Symbol_Kongsfjorden.svg){.absolute top="140" right="140" width="120" height="150"}

-   Developing portal for collection of [CTD data](193.50.85.104:4949/kongCTD/) in Kongsfjorden
    -   Part of the Kongsfjorden flagship
-   Represented FACE-IT for [Hack the Arctic](https://hackthearctic.com/) hackathon
    -   Finished #2 with a [data portal](https://robert-schlegel.shinyapps.io/svalbard/) for trends around Svalbard
