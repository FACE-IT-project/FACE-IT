# Follow the outline in the submitted abstract

# Have a specific focus on social science data
## This is important because little effort has been done for social science so fart
## List the social science data that have been identified
## Solicit new input from people in the crowd about other social data, including Greenland
## What sort of non-social data do social scientists want
## Get the number of inhabitants of Longyearbyen over time and relate that to nutrient concentration
# Keep in mind that this analysis is just an example to stimulate the audience to think about real analyses
# These then are to be used for the review paper
