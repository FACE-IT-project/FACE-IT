# Overview

Data portals like [NPDC](https://data.npolar.no/home/), [SIOS](https://sios-svalbard.org/metadata_search), [PANGAEA](https://pangaea.de/), and others provide a lot of **FAIR** data (**F**indable, **A**vailable, **I**nteroperable, and **R**euseable) for Svalbard. However, should an investigation require access to multiple different variables (e.g. ocean temperature, ChlA, sea ice thickness, tourist arrivals) researchers may find themselves inundated with various data files and formats, which may lead to more time spent on data wrangling than on research. This is a stumbling block in the **R**euseability of the data currently hosted on data portals. As part of the Horizon2020 project **FACE-IT**, experts across many fields of social and natural sciences identified a list of important drivers of change in European Arctic fjord and adjacent coastal socio-ecological systems. These data were sourced, amalgamated (Table \@ref(tab:tab1)), and are referenced in a central [meta-database](https://face-it-project.github.io/WP1/metadatabase.html) (_follow QR code_). An example analysis highlights the functionality of these combined data.

```{r, tab1}
knitr::kable(
  data.frame(Site = c("Svalbard", "Kongsfjorden", "Isfjorden", "Storfjorden"),
            NPDC = c(10, 7, 3, 0),
            SIOS = c(0, 0, 3, 0),
            PANGAEA = c(1740, 130, 215, 84),
            other = c(5, 10, 7, 0)), 
  format = "html",
  caption = "Sources for the datasets amalgamated for FACE-IT. Note that there is a heavy focus on time series and station datasets. No geo-spatial datasets are included (e.g. bathymetry, glacier topography).",
  # align = "c",
  escape = FALSE)

# Example analysis

My current plan is to create meaned time series for the daily/monthly data in the separate parts of the fjord (i.e. inner, middle, mouth, outer) for some of the core key drivers identified for the review paper. Temperature, PAR, and ice cover OR ChlA OR pCO2. The final variable choice will depend on availability of those drivers in the main dataset. I then would like to perform a marine heatwave analysis [@Hobday2016; @Hobday2018]. The main objective is to show how different from different datasets can be brought together to show more than any single dataset could. WMO climate normals [@WMO2018]

# Results

The results will be shown with a two panel figure (Figure \@ref(fig:fig1)). Regions adapted from @Hop2002. The first panel will be a map of Kongsfjorden that shows the data points used and which part of the fjord they are in (i.e. inner, middle, mouth, outer). The second panel will be a series of averaged time series for the variables mentioned above.

```{r, fig1, fig.cap='This is a placeholder.', out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("~/WP1/figures/map_kongsfjorden.png")
```

The objective for this figure (Figure \@ref(fig:fig2)) is to show a bubble plot that illustrates the relationship between the chosen variables.

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, collapse=TRUE, fig.cap='This is another placeholder.', fig.height=3.5, out.width="80%"}
#trim whitespace
par(mar=c(2,2,0,0))
#plot boxplots
boxplot(iris$Sepal.Width~iris$Species,
        col = "#008080", 
        border = "#0b4545",
        ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)",
        xlab = "Species")
```
